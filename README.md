# IPFS Tray

Tiny program that allows to quickly stop and start IPFS.

Built for Linux using Qt.

PKGBUILD is not yet correct. No makefile yet either. Kind of a slackware, yet handy.

Current release (v0.1-1): 

* English Translations: Not OK
* Correct icon paths: Not OK (Only supports Adawaita, Vertex-maia won't work)
* AUR Distribution: Not OK
* Building instructions: Not OK
* Correct Coding style: Not OK
* Add files to IPFS: Not OK
* GUI launch at startup: Not OK
* Correct project structure: Not OK

I guess contributors are welcome then :)
